Array
	1. Reverse Array - 2 Pointer
	2. Min-Max in Array
	3. Kth Max / Kth Min - Priority_Queue
	4. Sort 0s, 1s and 2s array - 3 Pointer - Single Iteration
	5. Move all the negative elements to one side of the array - Same as Sort 0s, 1s and 2s but simpler version
	6. Find the Union and Intersection of the two sorted arrays - Two Pointers when sorted
	7. Rotate array by K elements - Reversal Approach [For Left : k, n - k] [For Right : n - k, k], Reverse rest to counter undesired effect
	8. Largest Sum Contiguos array - Kadane's algorithm
	9. Minimise the maximum difference between heights - Intuition based
